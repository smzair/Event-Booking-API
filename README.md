# Event Booking API â€“ Laravel

A full-featured, RESTful API built with Laravel that allows users to manage events, attendees, and bookings with real-time capacity validation, duplicate prevention, and a modular design. This project can also extend to a serverless notification architecture using AWS services.

â¸»

Key Features
	â€¢	Event Management: Create, update, delete, and list events with country-based location handling.
	â€¢	Attendee Management: Register and manage attendees via secure endpoints.
	â€¢	Booking System: Allow attendees to book events while preventing overbooking and duplicate registrations.
	â€¢	Validation & Error Handling: Clean API responses with form request validations and exception handling.
	â€¢	Application can be easily extended for Serverless Notification Architecture, by adding just few more line of code to the controllers starting by installing aws sdk
 			
    â€¢ composer require aws/aws-sdk-php

 and then utilizing the Service/Example_Notification.php file by calling before each event response by 
 // Send to AWS EventBridge 
 
    NotificationService::sendBookingNotification($booking);


ðŸ§± How to Run This Application
Important: This is not a standalone Laravel project. It's meant to be integrated into a fresh Laravel 10 application.

Step 1: Create a new Laravel 10 project

	  â€¢ composer create-project laravel/laravel event-booking

	  â€¢ cd event-booking

Step 2: Clone this repository separately

  	â€¢ git clone https://github.com/smzair/Event-Booking-API.git event-booking-api


Step 3: Copy folders and files into your Laravel project
Replace or merge the following folders in your Laravel project:

	
	From event-booking-api/            âžœ    To your Laravel project
	â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€         â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
	app/Http/Controllers/Api           âžœ    app/Http/Controllers/Api
	app/Models                         âžœ    app/Models
	app/Services                       âžœ    app/Services
	app/Http/Requests                  âžœ    app/Http/Requests
	routes/api.php                     âžœ    routes/api.php (Overwrite this file)
	database/migrations                âžœ    database/migrations (Merge new migrations)
	tests/Feature                      âžœ    tests/Feature (test cases)


Manually create any missing folders such as Services if your Laravel project doesn't already have them.

Step 4: Install dependencies
  â€¢ composer install

Step 5: Set up environment variables
 â€¢  cp .env.example .env
 â€¢ php artisan key:generate

Update the .env file to set your database credentials.

Step 6: Run migrations
 â€¢ php artisan migrate

Step 7: Serve the application
 â€¢ php artisan serve

Your API will now be available at http://localhost:8000.

Implementation for this rest app

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de3585fb-9ea6-4f26-9734-b5a4bca7506e)

# Note: While this application is implemented using Laravel (PHP) to align with the job role and technology requirements, a more lightweight and faster alternative could be achieved using Python with FastAPI. FastAPI offers asynchronous capabilities, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and a streamlined approach for building modern RESTful APIs efficiently.
